# Radiant Malignance - Base
![logo image](./docs/logo.png)
This is a base mod for Radiance Malignance. Issues related to the modpack and the basemod should be directed here.
**DO NOT REPORT ERRORS YOU ENCOUNTER IN THE MODPACK TO THE MOD DEV** unless you know what you're doing. Cross-mod interactions are supposed to be messy and it should be reported here instead.

Refer to the [official page](https://prodzpod.github.io/RadiantMalignance/index.html) for credits and changelog.

## Note: Optimization
Yes I know the mod is wildly unoptimized. This was my first RoR2 project and the first C# project of this scale. Adjusting to the API took some time (I don't even think I know all the helper functions yet), and there were definitely large obstacles. Feel free to mess with the code, push a PR, whatever. go nuts. Thank you for visiting this.
