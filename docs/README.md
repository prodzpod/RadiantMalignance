# Radiant Malignance - Prerelease

> Kitchen Sink pushed to its logical extreme  
> Proper introduction soon:tm:

**DO NOT REPORT ERRORS YOU ENCOUNTER IN THE MODPACK TO THE MOD DEV** unless you know what you're doing. Cross-mod interactions are supposed to be messy and it should be reported [here](https://github.com/prodzpod/RadiantMalignance/issues) instead.

**Radiant Malignance** is a content expansion aiming to weave various mods into a continuous, monolithic experience. It's designed to mimic how the base game presents its elements, but with a lot more content.

Refer to the [official page](https://prodzpod.github.io/RadiantMalignance/index.html) for credits and changelog.

## Note: Survivors of the Void
SotV is **heavily recommended** when playing this modpack as many features are tied in with SotV in mind. the modpack without SotV is **not tested** and can lead to diminished experience.

## Note: Prerelease
Some features are missing in the prerelease versions of the game. This release is subject to change. Although I don't see major changes in its future, **It is advised against that you make serious progress.** fully expect to make a new profile once the proper release version drops.

## Note: Balancing
> Modified instance of [WRB](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheBestAssociatedLargelyLudicrousSillyheadGroup/WellRoundedBalance/) will be added to Prerelease 2.

Hopoo isn't known for its balance, and so am I. While I tuned the game for my experience (and I do have quite a lot of hours in this game), I do not consider myself a skilled player or someone who is confident in their balance intuitions. Feel free to leave suggestions in the modpack's [issues page](https://github.com/prodzpod/RadiantMalignance/issues) if you have any balance related suggestions, and I will consider implementing them.

## Note: Do Not Update Mods
**Do not update mods!** this modpack attempts to "fill in" WIP contents from other mods for the time being, as well as utilize old features from some mod(s). Pressing the "update all" button, while tempting, can cause the modpack to break. I will monitor for mod updates and will update the modpack once significant changes have been made / as long as I have time.
